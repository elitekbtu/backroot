# üåê Language Support Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive language support to the V2V (Voice-to-Voice) application, allowing users to select between Kazakh (“ö–∞–∑–∞“õ—à–∞), Russian (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π), and English languages for AI responses.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### Frontend Components
- **LanguageSelector**: Interactive dropdown component for language selection
- **LanguageContext**: React context for managing language state across the application
- **Persistent Storage**: Language preference saved in localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, desktop, and kiosk modes

### Backend Services
- **Language-aware Prompts**: AI system prompts generated based on selected language
- **Voice Mapping**: Different TTS voices for different languages
- **Location Context**: Location information provided in the selected language
- **API Integration**: Language parameter passed through all API calls

## üìÅ Files Modified/Created

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/context/LanguageContext.tsx` - Language context management
- `frontend/src/components/LanguageSelector.tsx` - Language selection UI
- `frontend/src/pages/V2V.tsx` - Updated to include language selector
- `frontend/src/api/v2v.ts` - Updated to pass language parameter
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added LanguageProvider wrapper

### Backend
- `backend/app/services/voice/v2v_service.py` - Language-aware prompt generation
- `backend/app/services/voice/openai_client.py` - Language-specific TTS voices
- `backend/app/services/voice/router.py` - Added HTTP endpoint for text processing

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Language Selection
Users can select their preferred language using the dropdown in the location status panel:
- üá∞üáø “ö–∞–∑–∞“õ—à–∞ (Kazakh)
- üá∑üá∫ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian)  
- üá∫üá∏ English (English)

### 2. Language Persistence
The selected language is automatically saved to localStorage and restored on page reload.

### 3. AI Response Generation
When a user sends a text message:
1. The selected language is sent to the backend
2. The AI generates a response using language-specific prompts
3. The response is converted to speech using the appropriate voice
4. The response is returned in the selected language

### 4. Voice Selection
Different languages use different TTS voices for optimal pronunciation:
- Kazakh: `alloy` voice
- Russian: `nova` voice  
- English: `alloy` voice

## üîß Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to the V2V page
2. In the location status panel, find the "–Ø–∑—ã–∫ –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç–∞" section
3. Click the language dropdown and select your preferred language
4. Send text messages - AI will respond in the selected language

### For Developers
```typescript
// Using the language context
import { useLanguage } from '../context/LanguageContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { language, setLanguage, getLanguageName } = useLanguage();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current language: {getLanguageName(language)}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setLanguage('ru')}>
        Switch to Russian
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the language support tests:
```bash
python3 simple_language_test.py
```

This will verify:
- Language codes are valid
- Voice mapping works correctly
- Prompt templates contain expected keywords
- Frontend integration is working

## üåç Language-Specific Features

### Kazakh (“ö–∞–∑–∞“õ—à–∞)
- Uses Kazakh language prompts
- Includes Kazakh cultural context
- Optimized for Kazakh pronunciation

### Russian (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π)
- Uses Russian language prompts
- Includes Russian cultural context
- Uses `nova` voice for better Russian pronunciation

### English (English)
- Uses English language prompts
- Includes English cultural context
- Uses `alloy` voice for clear English pronunciation

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the language support system:
1. **More Languages**: Add support for additional languages
2. **Auto-Detection**: Detect user's preferred language from browser settings
3. **Voice Customization**: Allow users to select different voices
4. **Translation**: Add translation capabilities between languages
5. **Cultural Adaptation**: More sophisticated cultural context adaptation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Language not persisting**: Check if localStorage is enabled
2. **Wrong voice used**: Verify voice mapping in `openai_client.py`
3. **AI responds in wrong language**: Check prompt generation in `v2v_service.py`

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging to see language selection in action:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## üìù Notes

- Language selection is per-session and persists across page reloads
- The system defaults to Kazakh if no language is selected
- All location context information is provided in the selected language
- Voice selection is automatic based on the chosen language
